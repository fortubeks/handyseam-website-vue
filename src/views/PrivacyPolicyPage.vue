                    <p>
                      Handyseam is based in Nigeria, but our Services are accessible to fashion
                      designers globally. By using our Services and providing us with information,
                      you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to and
                      processed in countries outside of your country of residence, including
                      Nigeria. These countries may have data protection rules that are different
                      from those of your country. We will take appropriate safeguards, in compliance
                      with applicable data protection laws, including the Nigeria Data Protection
                      Regulation (NDPR), to ensure an adequate level of data protection when
                      transferring your personal information internationally.

                    <h3>5. Data Security</h3>

                    <p>
                      We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from
                      unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include encryption,
                      firewalls, and secure server facilities. However, no method of transmission
                      over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we
                      cannot guarantee absolute security.

                      claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. When we no longer need to process

                      systems.
